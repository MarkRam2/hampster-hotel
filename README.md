Overall very good bones for your project. Checking the 1920x1200 mode pretty much everything is accounted for except the fonts may not have been imported correctly or at all. You could use a little polish getting everything to look exactly like the prototype. Spacing, padding, and margins will help you fix a lot of that so keep practicing those. Responsiveness is pretty good. I like how you collapsed the navbar but the dark "hamburger" icon is a bit hard to find. Set it to white and you'll be gold. The square box on reserve should be an on-hover only effect but good work on getting it to show regardless.  You can also pull the icon out of the burger menu of the collapsed navbar to have it show at all times in the top bar via the bootstrap "branding" feature. Mobile responsiveness could use some work. Everything shows up but spacing is a bit hit or miss. Making the font smaller as the screen gets smaller will help avoid the situation of everything getting taller as the page gets skinnier. I can tell you know your HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and basic responsiveness. Very good job given the time constraints and considering we just learned this stuff. You're on the right track just keep practicing and focus on polishing the final product when you have time. Great work!
